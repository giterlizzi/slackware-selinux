# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libsemanage: libsemanage (SELinux kernel and policy management library)
libsemanage:
libsemanage: libsemanage provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary
libsemanage: policies. It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar
libsemanage: tools, as well as by programs like load_policy that need to perform
libsemanage: specific transformations on binary policies such as customizing
libsemanage: policy boolean settings.
